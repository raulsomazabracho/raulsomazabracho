Hello

My name is Raúl Somaza, i´m from Venezuela and i´m currently living in Argentina.

I studied Telecommunications Engineering, began my career working as a project manager and found myself really interested in data related topics. So i´m interested in developing myself as a Data Scientist.

I love programming in Python, making the most out of the tools that provides, and i also have knowledge in other data related tools such as: 
-SQL 
-Powerbi
-Hadoop
