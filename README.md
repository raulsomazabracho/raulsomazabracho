Hello

My name is Raúl Somaza, i´m from Venezuela and i´m currently living in Argentina.

I studied Telecommunications Engineering, began my career working as a project manager and found mysel really interested in data related topics. So i´m interested in 
developing myself as a Data Scientist. 

I program in Python, and have knowledge in other data related tools such as:
  -SQL
  -Powerbi
